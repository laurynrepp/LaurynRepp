# Community Service: 
#### Below are three examples of the community service I participated in and continue to participate in at the University of Denver. I am lucky that my lacrosse team views community service as a priority because it allows me to not only help my community but do so with friends. I have thoroughly enjoyed participating in the below activities and will continue to make them a priority in my life. 
## Denver Rescue Mission
