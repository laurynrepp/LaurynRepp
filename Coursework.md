## Barry's Database 
### - Spent three quarters designing, creating, and making my database functional 
### - This database holds reservation data for Barry's Bootcamp, a worldwide group fitness class chain
### - Can be used to track successful locations, loyal customers, the most popular instructors, and the most popular class times.

## Alteryx Workflow
### - I first learned how to use Alteryx during my internship at PwC
### - In INFO 3400, all of our work was done using Alteryx so seeing that what I am learning in the classroom is applicable to the workforce was very eye opening.
